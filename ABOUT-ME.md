I am a doctoral researcher at the University of Turku. I am currently working on my PhD in Digital Language Studies in the Doctoral Programme in Languages and Translation Studies [(Utuling)][utuling]. My PhD reserach lies at the intersection between corpus linguistics and Natural Language Processing.

I am a part of the [TurkuNLP][turku-nlp] research group.

### Research

I am a linguist at heart, although my daily work revolves much more around the programming language Python than any human language. Despite the technical nature of my reserach, I always aim to stay close to the language. In doing so, I wish to push corpus linguistics forward into adoting state-of-the-art methodologies that are commonplace in the field of NLP.

The overarching theme of my reserach is machine learning and textual data, although the specific methods and data have varied. I have trained deep learning models for Finnish parliamentary speeches. I have also done topic modelling for COVID tweets. Currently, I am working on developing methods for analysing and improving LLM training data.

### Personal

I was born in Helsinki but have lived in Turku since 2016. In my freetime, I am active in a local scout group. I also play the drums in a band. I can play a few chords on the guitar, too, and trying to get better.
